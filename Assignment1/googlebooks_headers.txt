The date and time that the message was sent

Cache-Control: private, max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-transform
Tells all caching mechanisms from server to client whether they may cache this object. It is measured in seconds.
private: Indicates that all or part of the response message is intended for a single user and MUST NOT be cached by a shared cache, such as a proxy server.
max-age=0: used to specify (in seconds) the maximum age of the content before it becomes stale
must-revalidate: When the must-revalidate directive is present in a response received by a cache, that cache MUST NOT
use the entry after it becomes stale to respond to a subsequent request without first revalidating it with the origin server
no-transform:  When set, proxies and transcoders are instructed not to change the HTTP header and the content should not be modified

the cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server.

The MIME type of this content and the character set it's encoded with

X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

response away from the declared content-type. This also applies to Google Chrome, when downloading extensions

X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Clickjacking protection: deny - no rendering within a frame, sameorigin - no rendering if
origin mismatch, allow-from - allow from specified location, allowall - non-standard, allow from any location
